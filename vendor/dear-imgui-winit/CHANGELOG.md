## [Unreleased]

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-14

### Breaking Changes

- Make `WinitPlatform` the sole public multi-viewport owner. `with_event_loop` now returns `WinitViewportAttempt`, which preserves the callback output and every deferred platform fault as parallel values instead of dropping one side through nested `Result` precedence.
- Replace one-at-a-time `poll_viewport_fault` with the advanced `drain_viewport_faults` escape hatch. First-party renderer routes retain an exact-generation platform adapter and aggregate the complete ordered fault batch automatically.

### Fixed

- Preserve secondary viewport client geometry when positioning undecorated Windows windows, changing native decorations, crossing physical-coordinate DPI boundaries without viewport scaling, or creating decorated X11 windows before their frame extents settle. Geometry and visibility events now wake the main window and retain unfinished reconciliation under `ControlFlow::Wait`. This fixes detached title-bar dragging and prevents native/ImGui geometry and initial X11 DPI drift.

## [0.16.0-alpha.1]

### Breaking Changes

- Replace the reversed frame lifecycle API with `prepare_frame(&mut Context, &Window)` before UI construction and `prepare_render(&Ui, &Window)` afterward. The misleading pre-frame `prepare_render(&mut Context, ...)` and `prepare_render_with_ui` compatibility names are removed.
- Replace the free multi-viewport `enable` and `shutdown_multi_viewport_support` APIs with `WinitPlatformRuntime::new(&mut Context, &WinitPlatform)`. `WinitPlatform::new` installs the sole Context platform attachment, and `WinitPlatform::attach_window(Arc<Window>, ...)` retains the main window while the runtime owns secondary windows and its callback claim without borrowing caller-managed callback state. Multi-viewport currently requires `HiDpiMode::Default`; custom primary-window coordinate scaling is rejected.
- Make `WinitPlatform::attach_window` safe by requiring `Arc<Window>`. The platform retains the exact shared allocation until detach or Context teardown, so the IME callback cannot outlive the window.
- Make `WinitPlatform::set_hidpi_mode` fallible. Once `WinitPlatformRuntime` is attached, both scaling-mode changes and main-window reattachment return `WinitPlatformError::RuntimeConfigurationLocked` without changing state.
- Route event-loop-dependent callbacks through the non-escaping `WinitPlatformRuntime::with_event_loop` closure. The active event loop cannot outlive the callback scope, nested scopes restore the outer loop, and callback panics or native faults are reported only after control returns to Rust.
- Use `WinitPlatformRuntime::shutdown(&mut Context)` for reportable ordered teardown. It closes any open frame while callbacks remain attached, requires renderer callbacks and viewport state to be released first, destroys secondary windows only while Winit still owns the destroy callback, releases the callback table, and detaches from the Context. Dropping the runtime without a Context defers native cleanup to the Context attachment.
- Treat `BackendFlags::PLATFORM_HAS_VIEWPORTS` and `BackendFlags::HAS_MOUSE_HOVERED_VIEWPORT` as exclusive runtime capabilities: attachment rejects contexts that preadvertise either flag, and teardown clears Winit-owned bits without restoring stale values after callback drift.

### Added

- Add `WinitPlatformRuntime::{poll_fault,handle_event,route_secondary_event,main_window}` so applications can inspect deferred callback faults, route main and secondary viewport events, and access the runtime-owned main window without raw callback userdata.

### Changed

- Register `WinitPlatformControl` as the Context's exclusive platform attachment. The runtime shares that owner rather than installing a second attachment; renderer attachments must be created after it, and Context teardown releases renderer resources before Winit destroys platform windows.
- Make explicit `WinitPlatform` and `WinitPlatformRuntime` shutdown transactional against the Context attachment graph. Shutdown now rejects an active renderer attachment before closing an open frame or changing native state; after renderer shutdown, the same platform generation can be retried, while Context-owned teardown keeps its existing renderer-before-platform ordering.
- Reconcile focus across all windows owned by one Context at frame boundaries. Focus transfers between primary and secondary viewports no longer emit a false application-wide loss, while a real loss clears stale mouse-button state so a missing release event cannot suppress later pointer-leave handling.
- Use Dear ImGui's native desktop coordinate contract throughout multi-viewport geometry and input. Windows and X11 publish physical virtual-desktop pixels with `FramebufferScale = (1, 1)`, macOS uses Cocoa points with its backing scale, and per-window `DpiScale` remains independent. Mixed-DPI layouts are supported, decorated Windows positions use the target viewport DPI, monitor publication refreshes at frame boundaries without taking ownership from another backend, and runtime attach/shutdown invalidates stale pointer coordinates while restoring the base single-window display contract.
- Stop advertising the unsupported `Platform_SetWindowAlpha` callback, synchronize cursor and IME state for new and existing secondary windows, route secondary-window touch input through the primary translator, and honor `NO_TASK_BAR_ICON` on Windows and X11. Windows `NO_INPUTS` viewports use native `WM_NCHITTEST` pass-through and per-frame native hovered-window discovery without changing compositor styles; moving viewports are raised above docking targets without activation, and mouse capture is transferred when a dragged viewport is destroyed. Other desktop targets use Winit cursor hit testing.
- Reject Wayland and non-desktop targets before publishing multi-viewport capability, fail closed for unsupported click-focus or taskbar semantics while treating `NO_FOCUS_ON_APPEARING` as a best-effort inactive-creation request, synchronize live decoration/top-most/taskbar policies where the platform supports them, and translate primary and secondary touches in the native desktop coordinate space with Context-local first-finger tracking. Native move, resize, and DPI notifications are authoritative platform feedback so decorated client origins cannot drift from the OS window.
- Snapshot only the `Platform_*` callback slots Winit claims at attachment and validate them before every Winit C trampoline touches runtime state. Foreign callbacks Winit does not implement, including alpha, work-area-inset, and Vulkan-surface hooks, remain outside that lease. Drift in owned callbacks latches a fault, revokes viewport capability, and blocks every remaining public callback; only the owned destroy callback receives a narrow runtime-controlled teardown scope.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-06-30

### Breaking Changes

- `multi_viewport::shutdown_multi_viewport_support` now takes `&mut Context`, matching the renderer backend shutdown helpers and making the target ImGui context explicit.

### Added

- IME integration:
  - Wire Dear ImGui's `ImGuiPlatformImeData` to `winit::window::Window::set_ime_cursor_area` for the main window and winit-owned multi-viewport windows so IME candidate/composition windows follow the text caret.
  - Add automatic IME management based on `io.want_text_input()` in `WinitPlatform::prepare_render_with_ui`, with explicit control via:
    - `WinitPlatform::set_ime_allowed(&Window, bool)`
    - `WinitPlatform::set_ime_auto_management(bool)`
    - `WinitPlatform::ime_enabled() -> bool`
    - `WinitPlatform::detach_window(&Window, &mut Context)` for clearing winit-owned IME hooks before a window is destroyed while the context remains alive.
- New convenience API:
  - `WinitPlatform::handle_window_event(&mut Context, &Window, &WindowEvent)` for `ApplicationHandler::window_event`-style loops, avoiding the need to wrap events in `Event::WindowEvent`.
- Examples:
  - New `ime_debug` example (`dear-imgui-examples`) demonstrating winit 0.30 IME integration, IME auto-management toggling, and runtime inspection of `io.want_text_input` / backend IME state.

### Changed

- `WinitPlatform::handle_event` remains available for closure-style `EventLoop::run`, but internally delegates to a shared window-event handler instead of duplicating logic.
- All winit 0.30 `ApplicationHandler` examples now use `handle_window_event` instead of constructing synthetic `Event::WindowEvent` values, simplifying the recommended integration pattern.

### Fixed

- Filter non-finite winit-provided coordinates, sizes, scale factors, and wheel deltas before forwarding them to Dear ImGui IO, including multi-viewport callbacks. This prevents `Io::set_mouse_pos()` / mouse-position event panics during window-manager-driven moves on Wayland/KDE. Fixes #35, thanks @AndreasPantle.
- `WinitPlatform::attach_window` no longer overwrites `Platform_ImeUserData` when another backend owns `Platform_SetImeDataFn`; it only updates the IME userdata for winit-owned callbacks.
- `Platform_SetImeDataFn` now resolves `Platform_ImeUserData` from the `ImGuiContext*` passed by Dear ImGui instead of whichever context is currently bound.
- Multi-viewport shutdown now binds the provided `Context` before destroying platform windows and clearing platform callbacks, avoiding cleanup against a different current context.
